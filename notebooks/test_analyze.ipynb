operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.  Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.  This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\\u201d of this Form 10-K.\", \"Macroeconomic and Industry Risks  The Company\\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.  The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.  Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\\u2019s products and services.\", \"The Company\\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.  Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks  The Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.  The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future.\", \"Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  The Company\\u2019s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\", \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements.  Interest Rate Risk  The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\", \"If the Company\\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  General Risks  The price of the Company\\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.  The Company\\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock\\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability.\", \"The Company\\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition,  \\u201d above, can also affect the Company\\u2019s ability to obtain components  Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.  The Company\\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\\u2019s requirements.\", \"Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\\u2019s business.\", \"The Company\\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.  The Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.  Business Risks  To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\", \"Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\\u2019s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company\\u2019s goals and initiatives.\", \"| 2023 Form 10-K | 10  The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\\u2019s products.  The Company\\u2019s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.  The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions.\", \"The Company\\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.  Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.  Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5  The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\u2019s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\", \"Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.  The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.  From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements.\", \"and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company\\u2019s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business.  Many of the Company\\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\\u2019s control.\", \"These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company\\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\"], \"key_opportunities\": [\"But equally important is the mix of what we sell, and obviously, growth in Services for us is favorable.
