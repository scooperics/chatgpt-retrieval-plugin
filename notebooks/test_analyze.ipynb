These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.  The Company\\u2019s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\", \"Macroeconomic and Industry Risks  The Company\\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.  The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.  Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\\u2019s products and services.\", \"The Company\\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.  Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks  The Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.  The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future.\", \"If the Company\\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  General Risks  The price of the Company\\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.  The Company\\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock\\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability.\", \"and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company\\u2019s business.

Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\\u2019s business.  Many of the Company\\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\\u2019s control.\", \"The Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.  Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.  This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\\u201d of this Form 10-K.\", \"While the Company\\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.  While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\", \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements.  Interest Rate Risk  The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\", \"The Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.

Business Risks  To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\", \"In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.  Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8  The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.

The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components.\", \"These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company\\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\", \"The Company\\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.  Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15  The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.

The Company\\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur.

The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\\u2019s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies.

Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point.\\\\r\\\\nAs a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks.

And so we're starting from a better position than a year ago or in the past in general. There are other factors that play a role. For example, the mix of products that we sell. Not every product has the same gross margin profile. And so our guidance, our results are reflective of that. And also within a specific product category, a lot depends on the kind of models that we sell because they have different margin profiles.\\\\r\\\\nI think one of the things that we've done well over the last few years is to offer more affordability solutions to our customers in the form of installment plans, trading options and low-cost financing in general. And what that is accomplished is reduce the affordability threshold for our customers, and therefore, they can buy at the top of our product ranges.
